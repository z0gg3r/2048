# 2048
An implementation of the well known 2048 game in C.

If the scores binary is or will be in your path, compile with Makefile.path.

Writing to the SCORES file is currently WIP and does not really work. Just
comment out the one function call for now if you want to play.

Dependencies:
- ncurses
- rustc
